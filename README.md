The LMEC digital collections live at <https://collections.leventhalmap.org>. As a Digital Commonwealth partner institution, you can also find any of our items online at <https://digitalcommonwealth.org>.

The over 11,000 items in our digital collections can be queried by a few different, related methods: JSON API, IIIF API, and scraping. As Digital Commonwealth partners, all of our collections adhere to [Digital Commonwealth's API specifications](https://digitalcommonwealth.org).

### Using the notebooks

To run these notebooks in [Binder](https://mybinder.org), simply go to Binder's landing page and copy-paste this repo's base URL `<https://github.com/itspangler/cogapp-hack-day>` when prompted. You can also clone the repo and run the notebooks locally through something like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
