    "# Accessing LMEC Collections via JSON API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides some tips for using Digital Commonwealth's JSON API to query the LMEC collections portal and programmatically retrieve metadata about collections items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve any page as JSON, simply append `.json` to the page URL. On the collections portal, this should be placed directly after `search`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # normal, return HTML\n",
    "    https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=lowell&search_field=all_fields\n",
    "\n",
    "    # return JSON\n",
    "    https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search.json?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Lowell&search_field=all_fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increasing max items returned from search query\n",
    "\n",
    "By default this query will return a max of 20 items (it's reading from the page). You can increase this to 100 by replacing `utf8=%E2%9C%93&` with `per_page=100&`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # normal, return HTML with up to 100 items per page\n",
    "    https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?per_page=100&q=lowell&search_field=all_fields\n",
    "\n",
    "    # return JSON\n",
    "    https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search.json?per_page=100&q=lowell&search_field=all_fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tweaking the query with other filters\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also tweak your search by adjusting things like \"Place,\" \"Topic,\" and \"Date\" on the collections portal itself before grabbing the URL. The following query searches against 2 parameters: 1) maps that match the keyword \"Lowell\" 2) with a date of 1850 or later. It also lists 100 items per page, although only 19 maps are returned:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # normal, return HTML with up to 100 items and a date constraint\n",

    "\n",
    "### Collections item-level syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "At the item level, `.json` should be appended to the end of the collections item, directly after the commonwealth ID:\n",
